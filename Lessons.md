1. To indicate that something is clickable, there should be some change to the cursor or the button
when someone hovers over it. One common action is setting the cursor to `pointer`. Another approach,
often used simultaneously, is to increase the brightness of the button by first selecting the 
button and then setting the `filter` property to `brightness(150%)`.
2. You can set variables for colors and many other things using `:root` and naming variables using the syntax `--varName`. You can reference these variables using the CSS function `var()`.
